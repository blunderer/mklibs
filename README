mklibs is a shell tool to list and/or copy all required libraries in order to have a working set of binaries.
Typical usage is when building an embedded system:

$ mklibs -L<path-to-toolchain-lib> -L<path-to-staging-dir-lib> -m 644 -s -o<rootfs/lib rootfs>/bin/*

This script depends on nothing but BASH.
This script doesn't remove sections or from libraries.
